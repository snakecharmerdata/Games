Create a desktop Sudoku game using Python and Tkinter. The app should generate Sudoku puzzles with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Challenging), allow users to enter numbers into empty cells, and provide a 'Hint' feature that highlights cells green if the entered value matches the solution or red if it does not. Include a 'Solve' button to reveal the full solution and a victory message when the puzzle is completed correctly.

Add a dropdown menu to let users select a background image for the board, with the following display names: 'Alien World' for pic3.jpg, 'Aquarium' for pic2.jpg, and 'Forest' for pic.jpg. Any other .jpg files should use their filename as the display name. The interface should be visually appealing, with clear cell highlighting and responsive controls for an enjoyable user experience.
