# Sudoku App Code Explanation

## Overview
This application is a desktop Sudoku game built with Python and Tkinter. It features puzzle generation with multiple difficulty levels, a graphical interface for user interaction, a hint system, solution reveal, and customizable background images.

## 1. Puzzle Logic (`Sudoku` class)
- **Initialization**: When a Sudoku object is created, it generates a new puzzle board and computes its solution.
- **Puzzle Generation**: `generate_puzzle(level)` creates a full valid board, then removes a number of cells based on the selected difficulty (Easy, Medium, Challenging).
- **Solving**: The `solve(board, randomize=False)` method uses backtracking to fill the board with valid numbers. It can randomize the order of numbers for puzzle generation.
- **Validation**: The `valid(board, num, pos)` method checks if a number can be placed at a given position without violating Sudoku rules.

## 2. Graphical User Interface (`SudokuGUI` class)
- **Layout**: The GUI is split into a left pane (controls) and a main board area. The left pane contains buttons for New Game, Hint, Solve, and a dropdown for background selection.
- **Board Drawing**: The board is drawn on a Tkinter Canvas. Pre-filled cells are shown as non-editable text, while empty cells are Tkinter Entry widgets for user input.
- **Background Images**: The `get_jpg_files()` method scans for .jpg files and maps specific filenames to user-friendly names in the dropdown (e.g., 'pic3.jpg' â†’ 'Alien World').

## 3. User Interactions
- **Entering Numbers**: Users can click on empty cells and type numbers. The app tracks these entries for validation and hints.
- **Hint System**: The `hint()` method checks each editable cell. If the entered value matches the solution, the cell is highlighted green; if incorrect, red; if empty, white.
- **Victory Check**: The app checks for victory after each entry or hint, and displays a congratulatory message when the puzzle is solved.
- **Solve Button**: Reveals the full solution and disables further editing.
- **Background Selection**: Users can change the board's background image using the dropdown, which updates the display name for specific images.

## 4. Main Loop
The application starts by creating a Tkinter root window, initializing the SudokuGUI, and running the Tkinter main event loop.

## 5. Customization and Extensibility
- **Adding Images**: Place additional .jpg files in the app directory; they will appear in the dropdown with their filename as the display name unless mapped otherwise.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The number of removed cells for each difficulty can be adjusted in `generate_puzzle()`.
- **Styling**: Fonts, colors, and layout can be customized in the GUI methods for a different look and feel.
